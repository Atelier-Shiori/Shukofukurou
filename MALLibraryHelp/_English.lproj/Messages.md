This only applies to the MyAnimeList list service.

Messages allow you to read private messages from other members on MyAnimeList.

* Reply - Quotes message contents and creates a reply to the message.
* View Profile - Views the sender's profile on MyAnimeList.

## Message Composer

The composer window allows you to create a new message to send to other users. Only one reciever can only be specified. BBCode in the message editor will be generated automatically from the rich text, thus using BBCode for text formatting and links is not required. For BBCode not supported by the rich text editor, you can refer to them [here](https://myanimelist.net/info.php?go=bbcode).

For list of keyboard shortcuts, you can view them [here](keyboard.html).
